# LibraryAPI
A simple library API written in GO using Gin https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin.

# APIs
GET /books - Gets all the books stored <br />
GET /book:id - Gets a single book with the matching id <br />
POST /book - Creates a single book <br />
PUT /book:id - Replaces a books information at that id <br />
DELETE /book:id - Deletes a book at that id <br />

# Test-Clients
These are basic python scripts used for testing each api, I simply would alter the values before running them.
