# LibraryAPI
A simple library API written in GO using Gin https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin.

# APIs
GET /books - Gets all the books stored
GET /book:id - Gets a single book with the matching id
POST /book - Creates a single book
PUT /book:id - Replaces a books information at that id
DELETE /book:id - Deletes a book at that id

# Test-Clients
These are basic python scripts used for testing each api, I simply would alter the values before running them.
